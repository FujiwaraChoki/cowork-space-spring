# Coworking-Space Project

This project was written in Spring Boot, in the Java programming language.
It consists of an application, documentation, and OpenAPI specification for the REST-API itself.

- [OpenAPI Sepc](openapi.yaml)

For this project, I am following an MVC like Modularity:

- Controller
- Service
- Repository

The Repository contains the code that handles the database and the JPA (Java Persistence API) framework.
